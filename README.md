# DevMatch
Dev Match project as lead by upskill's essential web developer course
<https://upskillcourses.com/courses/essential-web-developer-course>

I am Starting this project after completing the first 5 sections of the course. So far, I've learned the basics of html, css, and coding in ruby. I've also practiced the basics of git alongside the video tutorials. 
My files and notes for everything prior to this project are in the repository [here.](https://github.com/Jonah-Hansen/upskill-essential-web-dev)

<h4>"Dev Match is intended to be an app where entrepreneurs and developers can meet. The app will include a user interface, login/logout system (i.e. authentication), email notifications, subscription payments for premium services, and more. You will learn how to build all of this into an application, using code."</h4>

this will be my first ever full project!


due to incompatibilites with old version used in the course and the required versions for heroku, I am scrapping this repo and starting over in a fresh, new one. This will be good practice doing everything up to this point for a second time while also learning any of the differences with the newer versions of all the gems etc.
