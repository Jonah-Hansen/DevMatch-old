# DevMatch
Dev Match project as lead by upskill's essential web developer course
<https://upskillcourses.com/courses/essential-web-developer-course>

I am Starting this project after completing the first 5 sections of the course. So far, I've learned the basics of html, css, and coding in ruby. I've also practiced the basics of git alongside the video tutorials. 
My files and notes for everything prior to this project are in the repository [here.](https://github.com/Jonah-Hansen/upskill-essential-web-dev)

<h4>"Dev Match is intended to be an app where entrepreneurs and developers can meet. The app will include a user interface, login/logout system (i.e. authentication), email notifications, subscription payments for premium services, and more. You will learn how to build all of this into an application, using code."</h4>

this will be my first ever full project!
